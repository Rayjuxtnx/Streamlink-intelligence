## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293B7B) to convey professionalism and reliability. This color reflects the technological expertise and enterprise-ready nature of Streamlink.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212529) to provide a modern, tech-focused aesthetic with a light-on-dark scheme.
- Accent color: Subtle neon green (#98FF98) to add modern, tech-inspired highlights. This color should not be too prominent, in order to avoid an over-the-top or garish effect.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif (modern, machined, objective, neutral look) for both headlines and body text, fitting for a technology-focused brand. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Line icons: Use line icons (cloud, shield, code, network) to visually represent services and solutions in a clean and modern style.
- Spacious and minimal layout: Prioritize a clean, spacious design with a professional layout to ensure ease of navigation and readability.
- Subtle animations: Incorporate minimal animations, such as light gradients and moving nodes, to enhance the visual appeal without overwhelming the user.
